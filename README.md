# EndoMersion
_EndoMersion_ is a project of [NCT Dresden at the TCO group](https://www.nct-dresden.de/forschung/departments-and-groups/department-for-translational-surgical-oncology.html),
and comprises by now the master thesis project work of Peter Klausing.

The project is fundamental research in the field of camera navigation in laparoscopic surgery.
Here it firstly aims to bring together stereo-laparoscopic imaging
with off-the-shelf VR-Hardware (HTC Vive) to improve spatial perception,
and secondly to enable head-gesture driven camera-navigation
implemented by a cooperative robot (Franka Emika Panda).
The modular components are bound together as ROS-Nodes
but may work as standalone with out ROS as well.

## Presentation
The System has been shown at the [Dresden Robotics Festival 2021](https://dresden-robotics-festival.de/) as part of the research cluster [CeTI](https://ceti.one/de/) of TU Dresden.
